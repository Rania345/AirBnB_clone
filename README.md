# AirBnB clone - The console
### Description
This team project is part of the ALX School Full-Stack Software Engineer program, It's the first step towards building a first full web application: an AirBnB clone. This first step consists of a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.

### Environment
This project is interpreted/tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)

### Installation
* Clone this repository: `git clone "https://github.com/jemn21819/AirBnB_clone.git"`
* Access AirBnb directory: `cd AirBnB_clone`
* Run hbnb(interactively): `./console` and enter command
* Run hbnb(non-interactively): `echo "<command>" | ./console.py`

### File Descriptions
[console.py](console.py) - the console contains the entry point of the command interpreter. 
List of commands this console current supports:
* `EOF` - exits console 
* `quit` - exits console
* `<emptyline>` - overwrites default emptyline method and does nothing
* `create` - Creates a new instance of`BaseModel`, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the id
* `destroy` - Deletes an instance based on the class name and id (save the change into the JSON file). 
* `show` - Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id.
* `all` - Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name. 
* `update` - Updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute (save the change into the JSON file). 

#### `models/` directory contains classes used for this project:
[base_model.py](/models/base_model.py) - The BaseModel class from which future classes will be derived
* `def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)` - Initialization of the base model
* `def __str__(self)` - String representation of the BaseModel class
* `def save(self)` - Updates the attribute `updated_at` with the current datetime
* `def to_dict(self)` - returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of the instance

Classes inherited from Base Model:
* [amenity.py](/models/amenity.py)
* [city.py](/models/city.py)
* [place.py](/models/place.py)
* [review.py](/models/review.py)
* [state.py](/models/state.py)
* [user.py](/models/user.py)

#### `/models/engine` directory contains File Storage class that handles JASON serialization and deserialization :
[file_storage.py](/models/engine/file_storage.py) - serializes instances to a JSON file & deserializes back to instances
* `def all(self)` - returns the dictionary __objects
* `def new(self, obj)` - sets in __objects the obj with key <obj class name>.id
* `def save(self)` - serializes __objects to the JSON file (path: __file_path)
* ` def reload(self)` -  deserializes the JSON file to __objects
